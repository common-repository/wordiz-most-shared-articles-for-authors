== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you turned down this widget ? =

When we first released this plugin, our platform was called WordiZ and is now called 'Elokenz'. Since one cannot change a plugin name on Wordpress, we decided to turn down this plugin and create a new one. The new one receives all the upates and not this one.
